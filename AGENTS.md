# Qianshou Agent Instructions

Before changing Qianshou architecture or workflow semantics, read:

- `docs/architecture/control-plane.md`
- every affected role contract under `.agents/skills/`

## Boundaries

- GitHub, Git, test output, PR head SHAs, and Review records are evidence sources. Never replace them with an Agent's completion claim.
- Qianshou's local ledger records handoff state; it does not redefine external facts.
- Keep Developer and Reviewer independent. Reviewer findings return to the implementer; Reviewer does not repair code.
- Never merge, push, publish, deploy, or start an Agent from the dashboard without explicit user action.
- Keep the server bound to `127.0.0.1`. Never expose GitHub credentials or raw environment values to the browser.
- Use test-first development for workflow-state changes.
